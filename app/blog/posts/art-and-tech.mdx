summary: 'Am I a technical artist or an artistic technician? Yes'

In my experience of career switching into a tech field as a software engineer, I often found myself feeling insecure about my background as an artist. I studied art and animation in college, and the majority of my work experience is as an artist. I’ve been fighting impostor syndrome as someone who has a background and experience that’s the furthest away from technical as I could image. I’d been a hobbyist with computers and software for a long while, but that was just a hobby. What can an artist bring to the table in a tech role?

In my previous roles as an artist, I would serve as an interlocutor between the artists and the tech department. Two teams would previously be at odds with each other, because they internally have separate goals, but tunnel vision and don’t think about how their individual goals mean to serve the larger project scope or company vision. I would be able to speak for the artists to the engineers, and vice versa. Pipelines became more efficient, projects got out ahead of time, and separate teams saw each other as being on the same team.

My other aspect of being a technical artist or artistic engineer, is thinking about the visual medium of the work. Just like the programming is a language, art is a language. It’s just as important to the product. Sure the back end logic works great, but who’s going to interact with a CLI in current year? Another Dev? Okay, sure, that works, but most people don’t know how to do that. Most people won’t even bother with a CLI, even if they knew the commands. Visual language and logic is just as important as code logic. An unintuitive interface for a great tool, is a tool that never gets used. 

I had been feeling insecure and having impostor syndrome, but this week, for the first time, I felt like my seemingly separate fields of experience with art and tech are connected. My journey into tech hasn’t been a zigzag, it’s been a straight line, pursuing creativity and expression.
