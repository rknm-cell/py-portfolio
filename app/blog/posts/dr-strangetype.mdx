Has this ever happened to you? You're coding a project in TypeScript and what you want to happen just isn't happening, your functions aren't being called or they are and it's not writing to the db. You're chasing your tail trying to get something to console log somewhere so you have some clue what is going on. There are red squiggles everywhere you look, the problems page on your IDE is a wall of red text.

Over the past week, I had been working on an AI-powered recipe generator app. In that time, I had a monumental crash out where I had to reassess my approach to working as an engineer. Specifically it came to my work practices around type errors. I was getting incredibly frustrated with my project. Getting my work to write to a database. Unsafe assignment of any type was the bane of my existence. My app wasn't working the way I wanted it to. The front end wouldn't display the information I wanted, the backend response wouldn't go through to the chat interface, the response wouldn't be generated, the response wouldn't write to the database, the response wouldn't display to the front end. These were all problems that would have a common thread, the red squiggles.

Every time I solved a bug, the red squiggles went away. When I decided to focus on clearing out red squiggles and making sure they don't appear, my pace began to pick up speed and I started to understand my code better and how functions and data related to each other.

These type errors were things that I found to be annoyaning, until I started to embrace them and learned how to read the errors. They were telling me a story about how my code didn't work. The functions didn't take in data properly, because it was the wrong kind of data, the id was generated as a number and the schema needed a string. These objects that were generated by my recipe app were rejected by the database because they didn't fit the schema I had declared for them. Data wasn't displaying on the front end, because I wasn't passing it correctly.

TypeScript errors weren't my enemy, pointing out that I wasn't following best practices. TypeScript errors were my friend, helpfully pointing out when a function wasn't going to work, because I had passed in the incorrect variable. It forced me to be more present in the act of writing code, to know exactly what I'm doing with every piece and responding to errors, keeping me from thinking too far ahead. I had to slow down and give every aspect of my codebase respect. They demanded to be taken seriously.

I love type errors.
