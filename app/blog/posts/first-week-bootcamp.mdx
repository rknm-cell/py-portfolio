summary: 'My reflections on my first week at Fractal Tech Bootcamp'
---

This past week, I started the Fractal Tech bootcamp. This time last week, I was walking around Chicago, having completed an installation for Pfizer at an Oncology conference the day before. I am an artist, having worked for the past four years as a professional scenic artist, painting and sculpting for the field of experiental marketing, which is a decorated way of saying, popups and sets for brand marketing moments. In the time that I have worked in that field, I found myself drifting toward more technical roles and skills, and falling in love with tech all over again. I had grown up tinkering with computers, using the terminal to navigate files, swapping out parts and upgrading my home computer. I’m pursuin a technical role in my career which feels like a natural transition from art to tech, although I am terribly insecure about coming from an art background.

These are the my EOD reports for the week, detailing the excruciating but ultimately positive experience of working out technical problems and learning new things every day.The hardest aspect of the program has been to ask for help, although I’m quickly improving with that aspect and seeing the positive results of getting the instructor’s perspectives and experience. I’m proud of the work I’ve done and how quickly I’m progressing at with my work and skill. My main takeaway from this experience so far has been to open up, ask for help, and connect with other people. I’m excited to see where this leads me and how I will grow with this program and to see where I am when it’s over.  

These are the my eod of day reports and as you can see they are getting progressively longer as I become more comfortable sharing my thoughts on my work each day.


Day 1
Blockers: Struggling to get into a groove with OOP typescript. Not progressing as quickly as I'd like. 
Wins: Was able to work through some errors and push through some initial blockers.

Day 2
Blockers: I'm very frustrated with pull request and still getting a hang of creating pull requests. I thought I had created 5 pull requests today, but they were just 5 commits to the same request. My IDE was also bugging out and I didn't know it was doing that until it was pointed out to me by Parris. 
Wins: The styling came relatively easy to me compared to everything else.

Day 3
Blockers: I was having trouble figuring out why i couldn't load a new game. Eugene helped me a lot to work through the logic chain for why it wasn't working, which gave me a lot of insight into debugging it. 

Wins: I had a good idea of how express worked because I had felt really insecure about it during the technical interview process so I had drilled down on that. I'm feeling like I'm getting the hang of the program.

Day 4
Blockers: Ran into a bug that blocked me hard with viteexpress this afternoon while trying to implement sockets. 

Wins: Overall, I've been feeling like I'm getting into the groove more and more each day and having a deeper understanding of the work we're doing. I'm also finding a deep appreciation of typescript and type errors. I'm also liking the feedback I'm getting from code reviews, pointing me in the right direction.

Day 5
Blockers: I got bogged down and tunnel visioned on trying to get a feature where users wait their turn to play which I commented out and saved for later. I wasn't able to deploy today. 

Wins: I feel like this week has been a time of me shaking off the rust and really getting back into the groove, like I'm progressing in leaps and bounds. I'm also starting to wander around a little bit and talking to people about their projects and it's helping me get some perspective and inspiration from seeing everyone's approach to their projects.

End of Week report:
Blockers: The pace is a challenge to get used to, but I’m quickly getting accustomed to it. I’m looking forward to sleeping in on Sunday.
Wins: Asking for help, connecting with my cohort and instructors.
