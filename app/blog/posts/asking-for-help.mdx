This past week at the Fractal Tech Bootcamp taught me valuable lessons about managing my workflow and asking for help. We built a chatbot using Next.js and their AI SDK. I found Next.js App Router's folder structure and naming conventions confusing and difficult to navigate. Was my code in `page.tsx` in `app/[id]` or `app/`?

I also learned I didn't know how to read documentation. I treated it like I had to implement everything exactly as presented in the documentation. This dogmatic approach reminded me of encountering the hurdle in animation where I'd draw a new frame using the previous frame as a guide. I would meticulously trace the lines to make sure they were exact, but they would never be quite right. There was always an odd slight jiggle to the drawing. Then one day, as I was trying to finish my work quicker, I came across the realization that I didn't have to trace it, but use it as a reference guide. I would make a new drawing that references the previous drawing heavily but not an exact replica, because that would be very difficult and not worth my time. My workflow sped up and I was able to increase the quality of my work. That was exactly my experience with reading documentation. You learn what the code does and how it works, and you figure out how to implement it into your own codebase. Suddenly I was moving faster and getting features working quickly.

Another issue that came up during my week was not making much progress given the amount of work I was putting in. I would get stuck on problems and not know how to progress, either because I didn't understand what I was doing or I was going blind to my code, not understanding what I was looking at because I was staring at it too long. Eventually, I would raise up the courage to ask for help and the problem I was struggling with would be quickly resolved. I didn't notice that I was trying to insert into a table an object that didn't match the schema I laid out. The id was specified as a string but the schema I wrote demanded a uuid. Something that was quickly pointed out by a second set of eyes.

It's also a new experience for me to be able to work for long stretches of time and then see the hours slip by very quickly. I accidentally pulled an all-nighter when I couldn't sleep and decided to try to work on my chatbot for a little bit. Well, that little bit stretched until dawn and I saw the sun rise. I needed to find a way to make sure I didn't spend so much time focusing on one problem, so in reaction to that I started setting a timer anytime I ran into a problem that I couldn't fix in short order. This timer keeps me in check to make sure that if I'm not making progress, I need to ask for help.

Trying to speed through my projects and coding everything out all at once is hubris. I wasn't taking my time to check each individual feature to make sure it worked. I would then move on trying to implement four or five features at once and my app wouldn't work. I would then jump back and forth trying to do too many things at once, making a mess of my code. I needed to start chunking out my work in small discrete features, testing each part individually, and then again as a whole, but still always one thing at a time.

These workflow changes transformed my approach. By week's end, I was progressing smoothly from feature to feature, asking for help when stuck, and using my time efficiently. Before starting this program, I didn't realize how much my approach to work itself would need to change and what a difference it would make. So remember to ask for help, break down tasks as small as possible, and keep track of your time.
